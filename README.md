# PRODIGY_GA_01
Training a model to generate coherent and contextually relevent text based on a given prompt.Starting with GPT-2,a transformer model developed by OpenAI,the model is fine tuned on custom dataset to create text that mimics style and structure of training data.
# GPT-2 Text Generation with Gradio

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Gradio, TensorFlow, and the Transformers library to create an interactive interface for text generation using the GPT-2 model. GPT-2 is a state-of-the-art natural language processing model developed by OpenAI, capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.

## Features

- **Interactive Text Generation**: Users can input a prompt and receive text generated by the GPT-2 model.
- **Real-time Updates**: The interface provides instant updates as users input different prompts.
- **Easy Deployment**: Gradio simplifies deployment with a user-friendly web interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Gradio
- TensorFlow
- Transformers

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash

### Usage Notes:

- **Model Configuration**: Adjust the `max_length`, `num_beams`, and other parameters in `text_generate` according to your specific requirements.
  
- **Deployment**: For deploying Gradio interfaces beyond local development, refer to Gradio's documentation on deployment options.

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive guide for users and contributors to understand, install, and use your GPT-2 text generation project with Gradio. Adjust the content and sections as per your specific project details and preferences.
